## Google Weather IoT Solution

We are excited to introduce our IoT solution, **Google Weather**. Our product provides a variety of measurements, including:

- Indoor and outdoor temperature
- CO2 levels
- Humidity levels
- Weather forecasts
- Historical data

## Key Features of Our Box

Our device comes with several functionalities:

- Real-time weather announcements
- Light signals based on sensor information
- Vibration alerts

## Dashboard

Our Dashboard, like our device, enables you to view various indoor and outdoor weather data, along with historical data presented in graphs and tables.

## Project Structure

### Flask Folder

This folder contains all the necessary documents to run and deploy the backend of our product, primarily the `main.py` file. This file handles most of the functionalities and integrates APIs such as Text-to-Speech, OpenAI, and OpenWeather. It also sends the data collected by the device to BigQuery. The Text-to-Speech system, managed with GPT-3.5 from OpenAI, is also controlled from this backend.

### Streamlit Folder

This folder includes the documents required to set up and deploy Streamlit on Cloud Run. The main file, `Dashboard.py`, provides a sleek and functional layout for our application. One of its primary functions is to fetch the BigQuery data collected by the M5Stack and display it on our dashboard.

### UIFlow File

This file contains the complete code for our M5Stack. It defines the Flask routes and establishes an effective and relevant layout. Hereâ€™s a summary of its functions and the information displayed on the screen:

- Weather announcements triggered by the motion detector, limited to once per minute to avoid spam. These announcements Text-to-Speech are generated using a GPT-3.5 prompt and information from the OpenWeather API.
- Vibration alert when CO2 levels exceed 600 ppm, indicating poor air quality.
- LED indicators: Red when humidity is between 40-59%, blue when above 60%, and green when below 40%.
- Wifi solution: In the event of a connection failure, you can have back-up wifis.
